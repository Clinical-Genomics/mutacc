#Minimalistic example of case yaml file:

#case:
#The only required field for case is a 'case_id.
case:
    case_id: 'demo_trio'

#samples
#A list of samples. For each of the samples a 'sample_id' must be given, together
#with pedigree information ('mother', 'father'). A list of fastq files and a bam file
#must be given. Each case can be filled with an arbitrary amount of meta data
#for each sample
samples:
  - sample_id: 'child'
    analysis_type: wgs
    sex: male
    phenotype: affected
    mother: 'mother'

  - sample_id: 'father'
    analysis_type: wgs
    sex: male
    phenotype: unaffected
    mother: '0'
    father: '0'

#variant:
#'variant_id', 'chromosome', 'position', 'alt', 'ref' must be given.
