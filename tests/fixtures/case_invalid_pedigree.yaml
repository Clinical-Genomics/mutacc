#Minimalistic example of case yaml file:

#The only required field for case is a 'case_id.
case:

#samples
#A list of samples. For each of the samples a 'sample_id' must be given, together
#with pedigree information ('mother', 'father'). A list of fastq files and a bam file
#must be given. Each case can be filled with an arbitrary amount of meta data
#for each sample
